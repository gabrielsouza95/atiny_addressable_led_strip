# Corsa B WS2812B LEDs tail light using ATiny85

In this project, the code runs on a ATtiny85 and controls a addressable LED strip that have been modified to be used in a Corsa B tail light.

## Tests

While testing the led strip being cut in sections to fix those sections inside the tail light housing, for some reason the ATtiny85 stopped working although nothing was done to it to sop working, so now I'm using a Arduino Uno on it's place, as they accept the same program and runs similarly.
